# MusicUtils
An assortment of scripts for FLAC quantizers, compressors, and resamplers to organize a FLAC library for archival and portable use. Tested to work on Windows, but should work on *Nix.

Everything except `Normalize.py` requires you to edit the source code to add the paths to the required binaries.

Requires:
- [CUETools](http://cue.tools/wiki/CUETools_Download)
- [jniemann66/ReSampler](https://github.com/jniemann66/ReSampler)
